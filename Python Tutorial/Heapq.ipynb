    "`heapq` is a Python module that provides an implementation of the **heap queue** algorithm, also known as a **priority queue**. In a **heap**, elements are arranged in such a way that the smallest (or largest, depending on the implementation) element is always at the root of the tree, which allows for efficient access to this element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key **properties** and **use cases** of `heapq`:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of `heapq`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Min-Heap by Default**:\n",
    "   - By default, `heapq` in Python implements a **min-heap**, where the smallest element is always at the top (index 0).\n",
    "   - This means that accessing the smallest element is `O(1)` time, and both insertion and deletion operations (i.e., adding an element or removing the smallest element) take `O(log n)` time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficient Element Insertion and Removal**:\n",
    "   - `heapq` allows efficient insertion of elements with `heapq.heappush()` and efficient removal of the smallest element with `heapq.heappop()`. These operations take `O(log n)` time, where `n` is the number of elements in the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use of Lists**:\n",
    "   - `heapq` operates on standard Python lists, using them as heaps. There is no dedicated \"heap\" data structure, but instead, any list can be transformed into a heap using `heapq.heapify()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Heap Invariants**:\n",
    "   - `heapq` maintains the heap property after every insertion or deletion, ensuring that the smallest element is always at the top. This is done by arranging the list elements in such a way that for every index `i`, `heap[i] <= heap[2*i + 1]` and `heap[i] <= heap[2*i + 2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No Fixed Size**:\n",
    "   - Unlike some priority queue implementations, `heapq` does not impose a fixed size on the heap. It dynamically grows and shrinks as elements are added and removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Heap Conversion**:\n",
    "   - You can convert a regular list into a heap in-place using `heapq.heapify()`, which takes `O(n)` time.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Support for Custom Comparisons**:\n",
    "   - Though `heapq` by default provides a min-heap, you can easily simulate a **max-heap** by pushing the negative of each value into the heap (since `-x` will be treated as smaller than `x`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Use Cases of `heapq`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Priority Queues**:\n",
    "   - `heapq` is often used for priority queue implementations where elements are processed based on their priority (for example, always processing the smallest element first). It can be useful in scheduling algorithms and task management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficient Top-k Selection**:\n",
    "   - When you need to find the `k` largest or smallest elements in a dataset, you can use `heapq.nlargest()` or `heapq.nsmallest()`. These functions are more efficient than sorting the entire list when `k` is small compared to `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (Shortest Path)**:\n",
    "   - In graph algorithms like **Dijkstra's** for finding the shortest path, `heapq` is used to efficiently manage the frontier of nodes being explored, since it allows quick access to the next node with the smallest tentative distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Kth Largest/Smallest Element**:\n",
    "   - `heapq` can be used to maintain a heap of the `k` largest or smallest elements in a stream of data, like in the problem of finding the `k`th largest element from a dynamic stream of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Merging Sorted Lists**:\n",
    "   - `heapq.merge()` allows you to efficiently merge multiple sorted lists into a single sorted iterator, making it ideal for scenarios where you're dealing with data already sorted (e.g., merging log files from multiple sources).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Real-Time Streaming Data**:\n",
    "   - In streaming algorithms, where data is continuously arriving and you need to keep track of the top-k elements (or min-k elements), `heapq` is very effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Huffman Coding (Data Compression)**:\n",
    "   - In **Huffman coding**, which is used for data compression, `heapq` is often used to build the optimal binary tree by always combining the two least frequent characters first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `heapq` Common Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`heapq.heappush(heap, item)`**: Pushes an item into the heap while maintaining the heap property.\n",
    "- **`heapq.heappop(heap)`**: Pops and returns the smallest item from the heap, maintaining the heap property.\n",
    "- **`heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)`**: Pushes the item onto the heap and then pops and returns the smallest item in a single operation (more efficient than separate push and pop operations).\n",
    "- **`heapq.heapreplace(heap, item)`**: Pops the smallest item and pushes the new item onto the heap in a single operation, maintaining the heap property.\n",
    "- **`heapq.heapify(heap)`**: Converts a regular list into a heap in-place.\n",
    "- **`heapq.nlargest(k, iterable, key=None)`**: Returns the `k` largest elements from an iterable.\n",
    "- **`heapq.nsmallest(k, iterable, key=None)`**: Returns the `k` smallest elements from an iterable.\n",
    "- **`heapq.merge(*iterables)`**: Merges multiple sorted inputs into a single sorted output (returns an iterator).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import heapq\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example heap\n",
    "heap = []\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert elements\n",
    "heapq.heappush(heap, 3)\n",
    "heapq.heappush(heap, 1)\n",
    "heapq.heappush(heap, 4)\n",
    "heapq.heappush(heap, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Heap:\", heap)  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pop the smallest element\n",
    "print(\"Popped:\", heapq.heappop(heap))  # Output: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Peek at the smallest element\n",
    "print(\"Smallest element:\", heap[0])  # Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "`heapq` is a powerful tool in Python for managing collections of elements when you need efficient access to the smallest (or largest) elements, making it ideal for various algorithms, including priority queues, shortest paths, and top-k problems. Its efficient `O(log n)` operations allow it to handle large datasets dynamically."
